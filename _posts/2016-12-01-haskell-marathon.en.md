Hey folks!

Today I’m starting a *`Haskell’s`* marathon where I’ll dive in the *`Haskell`* programming language in the next 3 months.

Cool!!! But why? Well, I’m really interested to learn more about *`Functional Programming`*,  which I already learnt some concepts and I’m using them, and I think start this process with *`Haskell`* is a great idea.

Why learn *`Haskell`* and not other languages as *`Scala`*, *`F#`*, *`Elixir`* or so on? I tried choose one language which follows the *`Functional Programming`* principles as much as possible and *`Haskell`* is this language. *`Haskell`* is a pure *`Functional Language`* which try to follow the *`Functional Programming`* concepts. Beyond that, *`Haskell`* is a statically typed language which gives us some help using the *`Haskell`* compiler.


I already read a book about *`Haskell`* called *`“Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!: A Beginner’s Guide”`*, so I decided start my adventure making a revision of this book and what I learnt with. My goal is study 16 hours per week and each day share with you what I learnt and my understanding.


I hope we follow together in this marathon.
