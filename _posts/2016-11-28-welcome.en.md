Hello guys!!!!

Today I'm giving the kick off of my blog.

I'd like to use this channel to share with you what I'm doing and studiyng. In the last years I have been working with back-end and front-end and I still doing that.

Currently I'm working in [Babbel](http://babbel.com) with Ruby on Rails on the back-end and with JavaScript and mainly React on the front-end. Because of that, I'll write a lot about those tecnologies / languages / frameworks to share with you how I'm solving the problems which I have found and to get your opinion about the solutions.

Beyond that, I'm very interested in Functional Programming and in languages as Haskell and Elm. Then we will have a bunch of posts about these subjects too.

My objective here is not just share or teach something that I know or I'm doing, but I'd like to receive feedbacks about what I'm writing to be possible grow up with you learning as much as possible together. Therefore I invite you all to build the posts together participating with comentaries.

Thank you!
